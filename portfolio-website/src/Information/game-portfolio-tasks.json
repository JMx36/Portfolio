It was also in this project where I got to learn more about how networking in games work and how to tackle problems that come with it like latency and synchronization. I know there are still things left to do for this game, but I'm happy with what my team and I were able to accomplish with the time we were given to finish this project. I hope to be able to come back soon to this project and polish it enough to put up on steam for people to play (some people were asking for it ;) )."
